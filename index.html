            <h3>D1E1 - Introductions / Show & Tell</h3>
            <p>The first project is my PoU work, based on Body Positivity. I designed a card based board game for spreading awareness and for educational purposes to desensitise people towards talking about their insecurities and think critically why these insecurities arise and how we can learn to resolve them, since insecurities are a recurring thing. All we need to do is learn how to manage them. 
               My Second Project is my Client work which is still ongoing. I did the Logo, Branding, Stationery and website design for the brand called Hash Pod, which is a video production company based in Hyderabad. </p>

            <p>For reimagining and redsigning a new interface, we were given the topic Instant Messaging. We explored the history of language or written communication. Starting from Hieroglyphics, Carrier Pigeons, Typewriters, Telegraph, Email to Instant messaging apps like WhatsApp and Imessage.
               To make our presentation more interesting and engaging we made a figma prototype for a gamified overview of the history of text communication. The figma link is attached below. The pdf attached is the explanation for our presentation. </p>

            <h3>E6 - Mindstone</h3>
            <p>Mindstone is a device that transfers your thoughts directly from one user to the intented users' mindstone. The thoughts transferred here are primarily text based messages which also convey the underlying emotions or neurotramitters with which they were generated. Basic idea is what if you could Airdrop your thoughts to your friend at an instant.
               It is an inclusive innovation in the sense that any differently abled person with blindness, deafness or muteness can convey their thoughts easily without having a language barrier or skill issue for communicating with others. This device is perfect for on the go communication as well as has a privacy setting which gives you the power to decide whether to send the thought to whom and with or without the underlying emotion. </p>
